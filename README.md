The advent of quantum computing poses a serious threat to existing cryptographic systems, particularly those based on classical algorithms such as RSA and ECC. To address these concerns and ensure secure data transmission during the transition to quantum-safe cryptography, this project proposes a hybrid file transfer system that integrates Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) with NTRU, a post-quantum key exchange protocol, and AES encryption. The hybrid approach combines the efficiency and proven security of ECDH with the quantum-resistance of NTRU, ensuring that file transfers remain secure against both classical and quantum computing threats. AES, a widely trusted symmetric encryption algorithm, is used for securing the actual data transmission. This hybrid system enables secure communication today while preparing for future quantum threats, making it a transitional solution for quantum-safe security. By leveraging the strengths of both classical and post-quantum cryptography, the proposed system ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of files shared over digital platforms, offering a robust defense against evolving cyber threats.
